A proof of concept platformer created for a college course in 2014. Along with activating buttons and avoiding hazards, the player switches between multiple characters, utilizing their unique abilities. Made in C# using Unity version 4.3.3f1, this was a crash course in Unity's 2d animation system as well as object inheritance.
